Welcome! My name is Kevin and Iâ€™m a passionate iOS developer with professional experience building high quality apps. My experience range from developing appealing and responsive user interfaces to managing complex data models. I previously worked at Amazon, TELUS, BMO, RBC and a lovely startup called Curv Health.

What do I do:

* Sketch, design and prototype mobile user interfaces for various screen sizes
* Write fully object-oriented programs in Objective-C and/or Swift
* Write Universal apps using SwiftUI with Swift 5.9 for iOS and macOS
* Write full stack web applications using server-side Swift (Vapor)
* Animation, physics simulation and game programming using Core Animation, UIKit and SpriteKit
* Write apps that work with the camera and use computer vision for object recognition
* Develop data models for use with persistent data management using Core Data
* Implementing media into application (audio, image, embedded YouTube video, etc.)
* Transform a given app icon to be displayed correctly across all iOS devices

Other information: I am married and live in the beautiful and diverse city of Richmond Hill, Canada! I enjoy playing badminton, piano and putting together puzzle pieces.
