These two days I have been going toÂ networking events, asking around about the iOS industry. Yesterday I actually have met another independent iOS developer named Adam. Boy, aren't I glad! It turned out we had a lot in common. Although he used to develop web apps, he recently started to develop for iOS and he actually has an app in the app store "[Deep Journey](https://www.mitochrome.com/deep-journey/)". The app is a visualization tool for the Mandelbrot Set, implemented using Apple's graphic library "Metal". I was quite impressed that he is able to independently develop something like that.

At home, I have been learning from [Caleb Stultz](https://twitter.com/gurucaleb?lang=en)'s lectures about using Sketch. Here what I have learnt: Working with layers, styles, shapes, masking images, proportional scaling objects, text following a path, shape boolean, making symbols from groups and exporting graphics for different screen sizes of any popular mobile device. Additionally, I have also gone ahead and followed his tutorials on how to design a chat app simply called "Chat". From the looks of it, I think his designs are highly conforming to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines, which is essential in getting it approved for the App Store.
