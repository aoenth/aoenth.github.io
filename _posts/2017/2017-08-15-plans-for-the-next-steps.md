I know I haven't been blogging for a HUGE while now. I have been admittedly exploring different career options and cool stuff to do around Toronto. In the mean time, I have re-centered my career direction towards iOS development. I am once again back on track on becoming an iOS developer!

From the feedback I received from my friend WZ, my long-due Chinese Zodiac app is still not yet mature enough to be a "fully-featured, up-to-standards" iOS application. In the upcoming few days, I will be improving it from the following perspectives:

1. UX and UI
2. Importing contacts from the contacts app
3. Following [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/) closely

Deadline is set to be this Friday at 11:59PM! See how far I get!
