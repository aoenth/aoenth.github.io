Hello there, reader! This blog is going to be reflecting my journey towards a work life of a iOS application freelancer! I will be posting about my progress on anything I have learned or found interesting during the ride. As I learn more about how to use WordPress, I will also be making it look fancier and more personalized towards my liking.

Recently I have [posted](https://www.facebook.com/kevinpeng01/posts/857210541099804) on Facebook my "Pokédex" app and I was surprised of how many people liked it and responded with their thought and suggestions. I will continue to learn from both online resources as well as taking feedback from people I know.

Currently my goal is to be able to publish an app by the end of July this year, but I haven't really decided which of my app ideas should be the very first. My friend WZ actually suggested me to start working on an app as soon as possible, and learn lots in the progress. I think it is a great suggestion and I will allocate some time each day to work on the app itself in the next couple of weeks.
