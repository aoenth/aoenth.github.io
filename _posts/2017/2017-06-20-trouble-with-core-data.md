Have been playing with an "To Do" app to learn more about Core Data while traveling back to Toronto. Simple enough, UITableViewController takes care of all the cells for you based on IndexPath. But if you want to have custom TableViewCells, it wouldn't take either IndexPath or NSIndexPath. Frustrated!
