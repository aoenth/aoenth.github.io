Past week has been lots of meet ups, badminton sessions and interviews.

This demo Â "Imaginarium" is an app I wrote to learn about multithreading and downloading resources from the internet. The photos in the video are fetched live from Apple's website. Aside: these photos are actually taken by the iPhone 5 camera and was shown off at the Apple 2012 September Event. The photos look pixelated because of the compression that was done to make an animated GIF. The original photos are [here](http://images.apple.com/v/iphone-5s/gallery/a/images/download/photo_1.jpg), [here](http://images.apple.com/v/iphone-5s/gallery/a/images/download/photo_2.jpg), and [here](http://images.apple.com/v/iphone-5s/gallery/a/images/download/photo_3.jpg).

Here is the demo:

I remember I wanted an iPhone 5 so bad because it was so thin and light, running the then-latest iOS 6. Now every device has a 64-bit processor and iOS 11 is unlikely to even support iPhone 5. Time flies by really fast!
