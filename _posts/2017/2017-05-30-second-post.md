Welcome to my second post! Wow, today has been lots of coding around an app called "TacoPop" which utilizes UICollectionView to show different images of tacos based on available customizations. In the app, you can choose your own protein (chicken, beef, brisket and fish) along with taco shells (corn or flour), and condiments (plain or loaded) using switch cases in the class initializer. Also another class called "DataService" which contains code for all the possible combinations using these four categories. I will be completing it tomorrow and a screen capture will be uploaded for tomorrow's blog.

My friend WZ suggested an app to decide which movie to watch in the event when the ticket to our movie was sold out. I spend about 40 minutes and came up with an almost bug-free app "Movie Decider". From the "beta testing" with my friends, I learnt that hiding buttons causes Stack View to re-adjust the constrains, but having the UILabel.text as simply blank doesn't disable the button. It turned out to be an easy fix: UIButton.isEnabled = true. Other than that, they were quite impressed with what the app has to offer.

My friend and I solved one challenge together and another was work in progress. These challenges certainly motivated me to become a better programmer as a whole.
