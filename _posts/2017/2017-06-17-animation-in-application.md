So long story short, my friends and I have decided to make an app to decide where to go for lunch, so here is about 10 hours or so worth of learning and coding. Far from complete: To do: implement way to clear balls, get balls unstuck from the walls by having zigzag walls. Also to react to the bins which the balls fall in and notify user the decision. LOTS of credits to BC on deciding the color of the posts - purple.
