Amazingly, "My Chinese Zodiacs" has been approved and is ready for sale! I'm really happy about it!

It sure is exciting to receive such an email, at least for the first time! Hopefully the app will be released soon so everyone in the world is able to download it! Woot!

My next steps are:

1. Study UX Design
2. Devise an app design process for freelance jobs
3. Construct a proposal sheet for freelance jobs
4. Learn about app monetization
5. Perfect online presence by learning and doingÂ social media marketing
6. Continue to learn to code!

Expecting results before Christmas, fingers crossed!
