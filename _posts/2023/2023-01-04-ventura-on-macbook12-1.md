Today I've tried and succeeded in installing macOS Ventura on my MacBook Pro from 2015. It was originally running Big Sur and Xcode 13. Now I can continue develop apps using the latest Xcode - version 14.2. I'm really excited to try the new Swift features that were made available since version 5.6.

All this was made possible by the OpenCore Legacy Patcher project. I'm impressed by the sheer technical skills needed to make Ventura and Monterey run on really old devices like the MacBook Pro from 2010. They must have a complete understanding of the hardware differences and the software that's needed to run them. Then they built a program that further configures the downloaded OS installer to run on these old devices. They've also made boot selection and OS installer USB creation easy - all in one macOS application.

Although the new installation erased my Bootcamp partion, but I already have a gaming PC so I have no need for Windows anymore on this laptop. So far there has not been a single issue with the new OS.
