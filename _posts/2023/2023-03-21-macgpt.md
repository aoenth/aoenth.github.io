Today I built a Mac app to interact with ChatGPT 3.5's API. All it needs it an API key from your OpenAI account. With the help of [ChatGPTSwift](https://github.com/alfianlosari/ChatGPTSwift) I'm able to build an app to replace the web-based interface provided by OpenAI. No more human checks I guess?

Interestingly I specifically asked ChatGPT if they have plans to make this a paid service and the response has been "no plans". I am interested to see if the free version is here to stay.

With the release of GPT-4 I'm also very excited to try its API once it becomes available.
